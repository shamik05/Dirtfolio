          <p>Hi, my name is Shamik Haldar and I am a 29 year old Ottawa resident. I have always had a love for computers and puzzle solving which has lead me to coding. Currently, I am no better than a novice programmer and considering the wealth of technical information out there, I hope to always remain in a learner's position. This is my first website created with bootstrap. Like, Comment and Subscribe!</p>

              <p>A month ago, I had zero clue on HTML5. Since enrolling into the Carleton BootCampSpot, I have started learning HTML5. I understand its basics and have gained greater mastery over it. There is something to learn about it everyday or reinforce my understanding. The image on the left will lead you to my first homework assignment using HTML semantics. Fair warning, it hasn't been graded yet so don't take it as a final product. There is always room for improvement.</p>

              <p>If HTML was considered the skeleton of websites then CSS can be considered the organs, tissue, muscle etc. (You get the idea). Both are needed in tandem to aid in website creation. CSS was a greater challenge than HTML5 for me to learn because I am not great at designs. However, repeating the exercises from previous lecture has solidified my understanding. With that being said, there is also Bootstrap 4 which can be considered the plastic surgery of websites. This website is built using bootstrap and the image on the left will take you to its github page.</p>

              <p>Javascript excites me in ways that I had completely forgotten since high school. It's brought back a love for coding that I lost. In plain english, it's straight up fun. I believe my next assignment will be a password generator so please stay tuned!</p>

              <p>I have played chess on and off from 10 years old. I started with around a year of coaching at 10 before migrating to Canada. If I had stayed connected with the chess culture then no doubt, I would have strived to get a GM title. For most periods, I self taught and grew as a player. Right now, I only play online (albeit a while ago) at lichess while trying to get a chess.com membership account. I am looking to set up a match between myself and my TA Laith Harb. I don't think he has a chance. You can check out my profile by clicking the left image.</p>
